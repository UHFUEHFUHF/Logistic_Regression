# 📊 Social Network Ads - Logistic Regression Model

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple Machine Learning project where I built a **Logistic Regression model** to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their **Age** and **Estimated Salary** — using real-world-like data from a social network ad campaign.

## 🔍 What this project does

- Loads and explores the dataset using **Pandas**
- Prepares data using **train-test split**
- Applies **feature scaling** using `StandardScaler`
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** classifier
- Makes predictions and evaluates the performance

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

This project helped me understand:
- Why feature scaling is important
- How `fit()` and `transform()` actually work
- How logistic regression handles binary classification
